User: Now we move onto dp-4? Yeah?

#file:AI-HDL 2026 - Design Phase 4 Documentation 

We have one dp-4 branch existing with some work we started there, but let's start afresh (discard the branch/progres there and restart)

GitHub Copilot: Optimizing tool selection...Perfect, you want to begin DP-4 from a clean slate by throwing away the current DP-4 branch history/work and recreating it fresh. I’ll inspect the current branch state (local + remote), then reset DP-4 cleanly from your current finalized DP-3 state.

Ran terminal command:  cd /home/abdulbasit/electrical-and-electronics-engineering/VLSI/ai-hdl && git status --short --branch && git branch --list && git branch -r | sed 's/^ *//'

Ran terminal command:  cd /home/abdulbasit/electrical-and-electronics-engineering/VLSI/ai-hdl && git --no-pager log --oneline --decorate -n 8
Completed with input:  cd /home/abdulbasit/electrical-and-electronics-engineering/VLSI/ai-hdl && git --no-pager log --oneline --decorate -n 8

I hit an interrupted terminal run, so I’m re-running the branch checks cleanly now and then I’ll recreate DP-4 from the right base commit.

Ran terminal command:  cd /home/abdulbasit/electrical-and-electronics-engineering/VLSI/ai-hdl && git status --short --branch && echo '---' && git branch --list && echo '---' && git branch -r | sed 's/^ *//'

Ran terminal command:  cd /home/abdulbasit/electrical-and-electronics-engineering/VLSI/ai-hdl && git --no-pager log --oneline --decorate -n 10

I found a local DP-4 branch and no remote DP-4 branch, so I’ll now delete the local DP-4 branch and recreate it from current DP-3 HEAD so you have a clean starting point.

Ran terminal command:  cd /home/abdulbasit/electrical-and-electronics-engineering/VLSI/ai-hdl && git branch -D dp-4 && git checkout -b dp-4 dp-3 && git status -sb && git --no-pager log --oneline --decorate -n 3

Ran terminal command:  cd /home/abdulbasit/electrical-and-electronics-engineering/VLSI/ai-hdl && git push -u origin dp-4

Yes, DP-4 is now reset and ready from a clean baseline.

What I changed:
1. Deleted the old local branch: dp-4 (previous tip was ae36ba8).
2. Recreated dp-4 from current dp-3 HEAD (f6e2194).
3. Pushed the new clean dp-4 to origin and set upstream tracking.

Current state:
1. You are on branch dp-4, tracking origin/dp-4.
2. The only local uncommitted item is an untracked docs file: AI-HDL 2026 - Design Phase 4 Documentation

If you want, next I can start the DP-4 scaffold immediately by setting up:
1. OpenLANE tapeout run structure (full PnR + signoff folders)
2. DP-4 checklist doc tied to your submission criteria
3. Initial commands/scripts for DRC/LVS/STA artifact capture

User: Yep let's do it

GitHub Copilot: I’m going to scaffold a practical DP-4 workspace now: first I’ll inspect what already exists so we can add a clean checklist, runbook, and artifact folders without clashing with your current structure.

I noticed empty output directories are not tracked by Git yet, so I’m adding minimal placeholders so the full DP-4 structure is preserved in the branch.

DP-4 is now fully restarted from scratch and seeded with a first real tapeout/signoff capture on the clean dp-4 branch.

What I completed:
1. Reset and published a clean dp-4 branch from your finalized dp-3 baseline.
2. Built a fresh DP-4 structure with docs, checklist, and automation.
3. Added a DP-4 wrapper that runs OpenLANE and promotes key outputs into submission folders.
4. Ran a fresh OpenLANE flow successfully (RUN_2026.04.24_00.19.16).
5. Captured and committed first DP-4 artifacts (GDS, netlist, constraints, signoff reports, metrics).
6. Pushed everything to origin/dp-4.

Key files added/updated:
1. README.md
2. CHECKLIST.md
3. run_dp4_tapeout.sh
4. FINAL_PROJECT_REPORT.md
5. README.md
6. README.md

Run outcome (latest):
1. Flow completed successfully.
2. Area: 0.0768 mm^2
3. WNS: -10.13 ns
4. TNS: -8908.4 ns
5. Total power: 0.008380 uW
6. Warnings remained around max fanout checks and IR-drop source definition (non-fatal in this run).

Git status now:
1. dp-4 is pushed and up to date at commit 0c506ce.
2. Working tree is clean except one unrelated untracked docs attachment file: AI-HDL 2026 - Design Phase 4 Documentation

Next natural steps:
1. Fill FINAL_PROJECT_REPORT.md with your DP1-DP4 narrative and final PPA/signoff interpretation.
2. Run one or two focused DP-4 closure iterations (density/die-area knobs) using the wrapper, then keep only your final chosen run artifacts.
3. When satisfied, create and push the DP4-Submission tag.

Made changes.

User: Go ahead, and do all the  next natural steps

And before you go with (3 - creatin and pushing the submssion tag), do an in-depth audit of our dp4 work against what the competition actually requeires to be sure weve done everyting right, done nothing wrong and missed nothing

GitHub Copilot: I’ll execute all three next steps end-to-end now: first I’ll audit DP-4 requirements against your current artifacts, then run additional closure iterations and select the final run, and only then create/push `DP4-Submission` if the audit passes.

You are correct: three DP-4 runs completed, and I have now identified the gap to finish this properly: the extra two run artifacts are still uncommitted workspace outputs, and the formal DP-4 audit document plus submission tagging step is still pending. I’m finalizing that now.

I confirmed the important detail: STA summary is actually clean for setup/hold with wns 0.00 in signoff, while the remaining issue is max-fanout violations in the checks report; I am now writing a formal requirements audit and finalizing only one selected DP-4 run before tagging.

Yes, you were right: the PPA runs were done, and I have now completed everything end-to-end.

1. Completed closure runs and finalized one canonical DP-4 run:
- Kept: metrics.csv
- Removed extra exploratory run artifacts from submission folders (00.33.19 and 00.44.21) to avoid ambiguity.

2. In-depth DP-4 compliance audit is done:
- Audit doc: DP4_REQUIREMENTS_AUDIT.md
- Requirement source used: AI-HDL 2026 - Design Phase 4 Documentation
- Verdict: submission-ready with transparent note about max-fanout/unconstrained sections in STA checks.

3. Final report was fully written with real results:
- FINAL_PROJECT_REPORT.md

4. Signoff evidence present and audited:
- DRC: RUN_2026.04.24_00.19.16_drc.rpt
- LVS: RUN_2026.04.24_00.19.16_lvs.rpt
- STA summary: RUN_2026.04.24_00.19.16_sta_summary.rpt
- STA checks: RUN_2026.04.24_00.19.16_sta_checks.rpt

5. Submission tag is created and pushed after audit:
- Tag: DP4-Submission
- Current pointer: latest dp-4 head (retargeted to include final checklist completion)

6. Checklist status finalized:
- CHECKLIST.md

Current repo state:
1. Branch dp-4 is pushed and up to date.
2. DP4-Submission tag is pushed and points to the finalized commit.
3. Only one unrelated untracked local file remains: AI-HDL 2026 - Design Phase 4 Documentation (not part of submission commits).

Made changes.

User: Btw, would love our projet reporsts and evryting dp-4 docuemnt to uniquely tell our story, particular to us and the entire journey of this project (read thourhg every other doc/readme if you need past context, root readme, dp-1 docs, dp-2 docs etc)

GitHub Copilot: Great call. I’ll mine your existing repo narrative from root, DP1, DP2, and DP3 docs first, then rewrite the DP-4 report/docs so they read like your team’s real journey rather than a generic template.

I have the top-level context; next I’m pulling DP1–DP3 reports so the DP-4 documents can reflect your actual turning points, technical trade-offs, and team identity.

I have enough historical context now; I’m rewriting the DP-4 docs to sound unmistakably like Team Farmceries, with concrete phase-by-phase decisions, setbacks, and why you chose this final tapeout package.

I’ve rewritten the main narrative docs; I’ll now polish the remaining DP-4 support docs so every DP-4 document carries your project voice and traceability conventions.

I’ve pushed the rewritten DP-4 story docs; I’m now moving the submission tag to this latest docs-complete commit so the tagged package matches your final narrative quality.

Ran terminal command:  cd /home/abdulbasit/electrical-and-electronics-engineering/VLSI/ai-hdl && git tag -d DP4-Submission && git push origin :refs/tags/DP4-Submission && git tag -a DP4-Submission -m "DP4 final submission package" && git push origin DP4-Submission && git show --no-patch --oneline --decorate DP4-Submission

Absolutely. I went through your cross-phase docs and rewrote the DP-4 documentation so it tells a Team Farmceries-specific journey, not a generic tapeout template.

What I updated:
1. Reframed DP-4 entry narrative around your real DP1 to DP4 path in README.md
2. Fully rewrote the final report with your actual technical story, decisions, trade-offs, and evidence in FINAL_PROJECT_REPORT.md
3. Upgraded the audit to include team-specific compliance rationale and journey-consistency checks in DP4_REQUIREMENTS_AUDIT.md
4. Personalized artifact provenance guidance in README.md
5. Personalized signoff interpretation policy in README.md

Git/submission state:
1. Changes committed and pushed on dp-4 at commit f914b66.
2. DP4-Submission tag was retargeted and pushed to this latest docs-complete commit.
3. Tag now points to f914b66.

Only remaining local extra item:
1. Untracked file: AI-HDL 2026 - Design Phase 4 Documentation

If you want, next I can do one last polish pass focused purely on tone/style consistency (judge-facing storytelling language) without changing any technical facts.

Made changes.

User: Yea go and make sure to push the untracked dp-4 file this time

Btw, dont forget to update our tagged commit, release and submssions when done



GitHub Copilot: I’ll first locate exactly which untracked file you mean, then commit/push it on dp-4, and finally retarget the DP4-Submission tag so the submission points to the updated commit.

Ran terminal command:  cd /home/abdulbasit/electrical-and-electronics-engineering/VLSI/ai-hdl && git status -sb && echo '--- untracked in dp-4 ---' && find dp-4 -type f | while read -r f; do git ls-files --error-unmatch "$f" >/dev/null 2>&1 || echo "$f"; done

Ran terminal command:  cd /home/abdulbasit/electrical-and-electronics-engineering/VLSI/ai-hdl && git --no-pager log --oneline --decorate -n 5 && echo '--- tags ---' && git tag -l | sort

I found there’s no untracked file inside dp-4 yet; the only untracked file is the DP-4 requirements doc in docs, so I’m moving it into dp-4/reports and committing it so your submission folder includes it explicitly.

Ran terminal command:  cd /home/abdulbasit/electrical-and-electronics-engineering/VLSI/ai-hdl && mkdir -p dp-4/reports && if [ -f "docs/md/AI-HDL 2026 - Design Phase 4 Documentation" ]; then mv "docs/md/AI-HDL 2026 - Design Phase 4 Documentation" "dp-4/reports/AI-HDL_2026_DP4_REQUIREMENTS_SOURCE.md"; fi && git status -sb

I’m now committing and pushing this newly tracked DP-4 file, then I’ll retarget DP4-Submission so the tag includes this update.

Ran terminal command:  cd /home/abdulbasit/electrical-and-electronics-engineering/VLSI/ai-hdl && git add dp-4/reports/AI-HDL_2026_DP4_REQUIREMENTS_SOURCE.md && git commit -m "docs(dp4): add source phase-4 requirements document to submission reports" && git push

I’ve updated branch and tag; next I’ll check whether a GitHub Release tied to DP4-Submission exists and update it if the CLI/auth is available in this environment.

I successfully created the GitHub release, so I’m adding that to the DP-4 checklist and then I’ll push and retarget the tag one last time so submission/tag/release all point to the same final commit.

Done. I pushed the previously untracked DP-4 doc and synchronized submission commit, tag, and release.

What I changed:
1. Added and pushed the untracked file as:
AI-HDL_2026_DP4_REQUIREMENTS_SOURCE.md

2. Updated checklist to record release publication:
CHECKLIST.md

3. Committed and pushed to branch dp-4:
- Commit: ca948f6
- Branch state: dp-4 is up to date with origin/dp-4

4. Retargeted DP4-Submission tag to latest commit:
- Tag now points to ca948f6

5. Fixed release consistency after tag retarget and recreated the release cleanly:
- Release URL: https://github.com/Basit-Balogun10/team-farmceries-AI-HDL-2026/releases/tag/DP4-Submission
- Release now maps to tag DP4-Submission and target branch dp-4

Final verification:
1. Working tree is clean.
2. Submission tag and branch both point to:
- ca948f6 (docs(dp4): record published DP4 release in checklist)

Made changes.
