# AI Hardware Design League (AI-HDL) Webinar 3: Technical Toolchain & Design Phase 1 Walkthrough

**Video Source:** [Webinar 3 Recording](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rOaLiDxNm74)
**Session Lead:** Harish Kumar (Technical Mentor)

## 1. Context & The "Guest Room" Analogy

Harish opens by grounding the technical work in a specic analogy to clarify the project scope.

```
The House (CPU): You are provided with a fully functional RISC-V Core (specically the TinyQV
implementation). You do not need to build a CPU.
The Guest Room (Peripheral): Your task is to build a specic room attached to the house.
The Hallway (Wrapper): The connection between your room and the house is the tt_wrapper.
The Rule: You primarily modify peripheral.v. You must ensure it talks to the CPU correctly
through the wrapper.
```
**Speaker’s Insight:** _"We are focusing on modifying and optimizing the code, not rebuilding the complex CPU
logic. Think of it as adding an accelerator or encryption engine to an existing system."_

## 2. The AI-Assisted Workow: A "Live" Co-Pilot Strategy

A dening feature of this webinar was Harish’s refusal to rely on memorized commands. Instead, he
demonstrated a **"Context-Injection" strategy** using Google Gemini. He treated the AI not just as a
search engine, but as an active engineer pairing on the project.

## A. The Core Philosophy: "Don't Memorize, Generate"

Harish emphasized that modern hardware design involves complex toolchains (Yosys, OpenLANE,
Docker) with hundreds of dependencies. Memorizing every apt-get install string is inecient.


```
Speaker’s Method: “I stick with using AI to help me with tool installation, xing code, and generating
scripts.”
The Rule: If you don't know the command, describe your intent and your environment to the AI.
```
### B. Use Case 1: Installation & Dependencies (The "Scraper" Approach)

Instead of hunting through GitHub ReadMEs for Linux dependencies, Harish used the AI to aggregate
them.

```
The Action (Timestamp ~10:20): When installing Yosys, Harish didn't type the dependencies
manually.
The Prompt Strategy: He pasted the link to the Yosys GitHub repository or the specic error
message into Gemini.
The AI Output: Gemini generated a single, massive sudo apt-get install... block
containing clang, bison, flex, libreadline, etc.
The Workow:
. Ask AI: "What are the prerequisites for building Yosys on Ubuntu?"
. Copy the code block.
. Paste into WSL terminal.
. Crucial Step: If an error occurs (e.g., "package not found"), paste the exact error back into
Gemini to get the corrected package name for your specic Linux version.
```
### C. Use Case 2: Script Generation (Synthesis)

Writing TCL scripts for Yosys can be syntax-heavy. Harish used AI to write the logic for him.

```
The Scenario (Timestamp ~36:15): He needed a synth.ys script to tell Yosys which les to
read and what the top module was.
The Context-Injection Prompt:
```
```
"I want to run synthesis. Here is my list of les: peripheral.v , tt_wrapper.v. The
top module is tt_wrapper. Write a Yosys script for this."
```
```
The AI Output:
The AI generated a perfect script:^
```
```
read_verilog -sv peripheral.v
read_verilog -sv tt_wrapper.v
hierarchy -top tt_wrapper
synth -top tt_wrapper
stat
```

```
Why this matters: Harish didn't need to remember if the command was read_verilog or
load_verilog. He provided the intent ("run synthesis") and the variables (le names), and the AI
handled the syntax.
```
### D. Use Case 3: Conguration for Physical Design (OpenLANE)

OpenLANE requires a strict config.json le. One typo here breaks the entire ow.

```
The Scenario (Timestamp ~43:00): He needed to tell OpenLANE about the clock speeds and le
locations.
The Prompt: He provided the AI with the paths to his les inside the Docker container.
The "Human-in-the-Loop" Correction:
Harish noted that AI makes pathing errors. When Gemini generated the JSON, Harish paused to^
verify:
AI suggestion: "dir/peripheral.v"
Harish's Correction: He ensured the paths matched the actual directory structure in his WSL
environment (./designs/DP1/src/).
Takeaway: Trust the AI for syntax ("DESIGN_NAME": "..."), but verify the data (le
paths and clock periods).
```
### E. Use Case 4: The Debugging Loop

Harish explicitly mentioned (Timestamp ~39:35) that if the terminal throws an error, you should not stare
at it.

```
. Copy the error message (e.g., ERROR: module tt_wrapper not found).
. Paste it into the LLM.
. Action: The LLM will usually tell you, "You forgot to include the le path in the read_verilog
command," allowing you to x the script in seconds rather than minutes.
```
### F. Required Deliverable: Prompt Logs

Harish reiterated that this workow isn't just a tip—it's a **requirement**.

```
Participant Action: You must save these chat logs (like the one Harish had open on the left side of
his screen throughout the demo).
Submission: These logs serve as proof of your work process and are part of the grading rubric to
evaluate how effectively you leveraged AI to solve engineering problems.
```
## 3. Step-by-Step Environment Setup


_Note: This walkthrough assumes a Windows machine using WSL, as demonstrated by the speaker._

### Step A: Windows Subsystem for Linux (WSL)

Since EDA tools generally don't run natively on Windows, Harish sets up a Linux container.

```
. Open PowerShell as Administrator.
. Command: wsl --install
Speaker Note: "This defaults to Ubuntu, which is what we want. It creates a containerized
Linux OS inside Windows."
. Post-Install: After restarting, open the "Ubuntu" app.
. User Setup: Create a username (e.g., harry) and password.
Critical: Remember this password. You will need it for every sudo command.
```
### Step B: Setting up the Project Directory

Harish emphasizes keeping a clean workspace.

```
. Create Directory:
```
```
mkdir AI-HDL
cd AI-HDL
```
```
. Clone Base Repository:
```
```
git clone https://github.com/MichaelBell/tinyqv.git
```
```
Context: This repo contains the RISC-V core and the peripheral.v template you will
edit.
```
## 4. The Toolchain Installation (Live Demo)

### Tool 1: Yosys (Synthesis)

_Objective: Turn Verilog code into logic gates._

```
. AI Interaction: Harish pastes the Yosys GitHub link into Gemini and asks for prerequisites.
. Install Dependencies:
```
```
sudo apt-get install build-essential clang bison flex \
libreadline-dev gawk tcl-dev libffi-dev git \
```

```
graphviz xdot pkg-config python3 libboost-system-dev \
libboost-python-dev libboost-filesystem-dev zlib1g-dev
```
```
. Build Yosys:
```
```
git clone https://github.com/YosysHQ/yosys.git
cd yosys
make config-clang
make
sudo make install
```
```
Speaker Note: "This compilation takes time (10-15 mins). It depends on your internet and CPU
speed."
. Verify: yosys --version
```
### Tool 2: Verilator (Simulation)

_Objective: High-speed verication._

```
. AI Interaction: Harish asks Gemini, "How do I install Verilator on Ubuntu?"
. Install Dependencies:
```
```
. Build Verilator:
```
```
git clone https://github.com/verilator/verilator
cd verilator
autoconf
./configure
make
sudo make install
```
```
. Verify: verilator --version
```
### Tool 3: KLayout (Layout Viewer)

_Objective: Viewing the nal GDSII (chip blueprint)._

```
. Command:
```
```
sudo apt-get install klayout
```
```
sudo apt-get install git help2man perl python3 make autoconf g++ flex
sudo apt-get install libgoogle-perftools-dev numactl perl-doc
```

```
. Launch: Type klayout in the terminal.
Visual: A GUI window opens. Harish notes, "This is not a terminal tool; it's a visualizer."
```
### Tool 4: OpenROAD (Physical Design)

_Objective: Floorplanning, placement, and routing._

```
. Clone Recursive:
```
```
Speaker Note: "The --recursive ag is vital because OpenROAD relies on many sub-
modules."
. Install Dependencies Script:
```
```
sudo ./etc/DependencyInstaller.sh
```
```
. Build:
```
```
mkdir build
cd build
cmake ..
make
```
### Tool 5: OpenLANE (The "Manager")

_Objective: Automating the ow from RTL to GDSII using Docker._

```
. Install Docker:
Harish navigates to the Docker website.
Windows Users: Install "Docker Desktop."
Linux Users: sudo apt-get install docker.io
. Clone OpenLANE:
```
```
git clone https://github.com/The-OpenROAD-Project/OpenLane.git
cd OpenLane
```
```
. Initialize Container:
```
```
make mount
```
```
git clone --recursive https://github.com/The-OpenROAD-Project/OpenROA
cd OpenROAD
```

```
Context: This command pulls the docker image and drops you into a shell inside the
container. The terminal prompt changes to verify you are inside the tool environment.
```
## 5. Design Phase 1: The "Live" Project Run

Harish moves from installation to execution, demonstrating exactly how a team should tackle DP#1.

### Phase 1A: Setup & File Management

```
. Create Design Folder: He creates a folder named DP1 inside his directory.
. Copy Files: He copies peripheral.v (the module) and tt_wrapper.v (the wrapper) from
the tinyqv folder into DP1.
Speaker Tip: "Always keep your design les separate from the tool directories initially."
```
### Phase 1B: Synthesis with Yosys (AI-Guided)

Harish creates a synthesis script to check if the design is valid.

```
. The Prompt: He lists his les (peripheral.v, tt_wrapper.v) in Gemini and asks: "Write a
Yosys script to synthesize these. The top module is tt_wrapper."
. The Resulting Script ( synth.ys ):
Harish uses nano synth.ys to paste the AI-generated code:
```
```
read_verilog -sv peripheral.v
read_verilog -sv tt_wrapper.v
hierarchy -top tt_wrapper
synth -top tt_wrapper
stat
```
```
. Execution:
```
```
yosys synth.ys
```
```
. Output Analysis: The terminal prints a table of "Printing Statistics."
Speaker Insight: "If you see numbers here—cells, ip-ops—you are good. If you see 'ERROR:
Module not found', check your le paths."
```
### Phase 1C: PPA Analysis with OpenLANE (The Big Run)

This is the core competition task: getting Power, Performance, and Area metrics.


```
. Migrate to OpenLANE:
Harish copies the DP1 folder (containing his Verilog les) into the OpenLane/designs/
directory.
```
```
Path: ~/OpenLane/designs/DP1/
```
```
. Conguration ( config.json ):
He creates a conguration le required by OpenLANE. Again, he uses AI to format it correctly
based on the OpenLANE documentation.
```
```
Key Settings:
DESIGN_NAME: "tt_wrapper"
VERILOG_FILES: Lists the paths to peripheral.v and tt_wrapper.v.
CLOCK_PERIOD: "10.0"
```
```
. Running the Flow:
Inside the OpenLane^ directory:
```
```
make mount # Enters Docker
./flow.tcl -design DP
```
```
Visual: The terminal scrolls rapidly with logs (Synthesis -> Floorplan -> Placement -> CTS ->
Routing).
Time: It took about 5-7 minutes in the video.
```
```
. Success Condition:
The terminal displays:^ [SUCCESS]: Flow Completed Without Fatal Errors.
```
### Phase 1D: Finding the Results (The "Score")

Harish demonstrates where to nd the data needed for the competition submission.

```
. Navigate to Reports:
He exits Docker and goes to:^
OpenLane/designs/DP1/runs/<date_timestamp>/reports/.
. The Metrics File: He opens metrics.csv.
. Key Columns Explained:
die_area / Total Area : The physical size. Smaller is better.
Total Internal Power : Energy consumed. Lower is better.
wns (Worst Negative Slack):
Speaker Warning: "This is your timing score. If this number is negative (e.g., -2.5), your
design failed timing. You must optimize it until this number is positive."
```

```
. Viewing the Chip:
He navigates to the results/final/gds/ folder and runs:
```
```
klayout tt_wrapper.gds
```
```
Visual: The screen shows the complex, colorful layers of the physical chip.
```
## 6. Closing Q&A & Key Takeaways

```
Prompt Logs are Mandatory: You must save the conversations you have with ChatGPT/Gemini
(like Harish did when asking for the Yosys script) and submit them.
Team Formation: If you are solo, the organizers will pair you up after registration closes (Dec 19).
Computer Specs: "You don't need a supercomputer." The demo was run on a standard laptop. 8GB
RAM is the oor; 16GB allows Docker to breathe easier.
Timeline:
Now - Jan 15: Install tools, play with peripheral.v.
Jan 15: Competition Kickoff.
Discord: All specic errors ("My Docker isn't starting") should be posted in the technical support
channels on Discord.
