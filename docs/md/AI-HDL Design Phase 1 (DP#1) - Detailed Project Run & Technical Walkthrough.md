# AI-HDL Design Phase 1 (DP#1): Detailed Project Run & Technical Walkthrough

**Video Source:** DP#1 Example Project Run
**Session Lead:** Harish Kumar
**Objective:** Execute the full "RTL-to-GDSII" ow for the rst design challenge, utilizing the^ TinyQV

RISC-V core and the OpenLANE physical design toolchain.

## 1. Prerequisites & Directory Structure

The video begins with a pre-congured environment. To follow along exactly, your directory structure
should resemble the following before starting:

## 2. Phase 1: Local Synthesis (The Sanity Check)

**Goal:** Verify that your Verilog code is functionally correct and synthesizable _before_ attempting the time-
consuming physical design run.

## Step 2.1: Setting up the Workspace

The speaker creates a dedicated directory for this specic attempt to keep the environment clean.

```
Command:
```
```
mkdir DP_
cd DP_
```
#### ~/AI-HDL/

```
├── tinyqv/ # The base RISC-V CPU repository
├── tinyqv-byte-peripheral-template/ # The template for your assignme
├── yosys/ # Installed Synthesis Tool
├── OpenLane/ # Installed Physical Design Tool
└── designs/ # (Optional) Working directory
```

### Step 2.2: Aggregating the Source Files

You must gather the CPU core les, your peripheral template, and the verication harness into one
place. The speaker executes a series of copy (cp) commands.

```
. Copy the Peripheral Template:
Context: You are using the "Byte Peripheral" template.
Command:
```
```
cp -r ~/AI-HDL/tinyqv-byte-peripheral-template/*.
```
```
. Copy the CPU Core Files:
Context: The CPU les are in the tinyqv/src folder.
Command:
```
```
cp -r ~/AI-HDL/tinyqv/src/*.
```
```
. Copy Test & Verication Harnesses:
Context: Needed for simulation (though strictly for synthesis, only source is needed, the
speaker copies everything for a complete environment).
Commands:
```
```
cp -r ~/AI-HDL/tinyqv/test/*.
cp -r ~/AI-HDL/tinyqv/verify/*.
```
### Step 2.3: The AI-Assisted Synthesis Script

Instead of writing the Yosys TCL script from memory, the speaker uses **Google Gemini** to generate it.

```
The AI Prompt:
The speaker types the following into the LLM:^
```
```
"I want to run synthesis. Here is my list of les: peripheral.v, tt_wrapper.v,
[lists other les]. The top module is tt_wrapper. Write a Yosys script for this."
```
```
The AI Output (The Script):
The AI generates a script block. The speaker copies this code.^
```
```
Creating the File ( synth.ys ):
```
```
. Command: nano synth.ys
. Paste Content:
```

```
# Read the Verilog Files
read_verilog -sv peripheral.v
read_verilog -sv tt_wrapper.v
# (Note: He ensures the Top Module files are included)
```
```
# Check Hierarchy
hierarchy -top tt_wrapper
```
```
# Synthesize
synth -top tt_wrapper
```
```
# Cleanup and Statistics
opt
clean
stat
```
```
. Save & Exit: Press Ctrl+O (Write Out), Enter, Ctrl+X (Exit).
```
### Step 2.4: Running Synthesis

```
Command:
```
```
yosys synth.ys
```
```
Visual Conrmation: The terminal scrolls rapidly.
Success Indicator: The output stops at a section titled "2.50. Printing statistics".
Check: Look for Number of cells:. If this number is > 0 and there are no "ERROR"
messages above, your code is valid.
```
## 3. Phase 2: Physical Design with OpenLANE

**Goal:** Convert the synthesized code into a physical layout to generate PPA (Power, Performance, Area)
metrics.

### Step 3.1: Migrating to OpenLANE

OpenLANE runs inside Docker and expects projects to be in specic directories.

```
. Navigate to OpenLANE Designs:
```
```
cd ~/AI-HDL/OpenLane/designs
```

```
. Create Project Folder:
```
```
mkdir DP_
cd DP_
```
```
. Import Files:
The speaker copies the^ veried les from the previous step into this new folder.
Command: cp ~/AI-HDL/DP_1/*.v. (Copying all Verilog les).
```
### Step 3.2: The config.json Conguration

This is the most critical step. OpenLANE is controlled by this le. One syntax error causes the ow to
crash.

```
The AI Prompt:
```
```
"I want to run PPA analysis using OpenLane. Here is my le list... Top module is
tt_wrapper. Create the cong.json."
```
```
Creating the File:
```
```
Command: nano config.json
Paste Content (Exact Structure Shown):
```
```
{
"DESIGN_NAME": "tt_wrapper",
"VERILOG_FILES": [
"dir::peripheral.v",
"dir::tt_wrapper.v"
],
"CLOCK_PORT": "clk",
"CLOCK_PERIOD": 10.0,
"FP_SIZING": "absolute",
"DIE_AREA": "0 0 160 100",
"PL_TARGET_DENSITY": 0.
}
```
```
Critical Detail: The speaker highlights the dir:: prex.
Meaning: dir:: tells OpenLANE to look in the current directory inside the Docker
container. Without this, it will fail to nd your les.
```
### Step 3.3: Running the Flow (The "Docker" Step)


```
. Go to OpenLANE Root:
```
```
cd ~/AI-HDL/OpenLane
```
```
. Enter Docker Container:
```
```
make mount
```
```
Visual Change: The prompt changes to: OpenLane Container
(f3b...):/openlane$. You are now inside the tool.
```
```
. Execute the Flow:
```
```
./flow.tcl -design DP_
```
### Step 3.4: Monitoring the Run

The terminal will display a sequence of steps. The speaker notes these stages:

```
. Synthesis: (Yosys runs again to map to the specic SkyWater 130nm technology).
. Floorplan: (Dening the 160x100 chip boundary).
. Placement: (Placing standard cells).
. CTS: (Clock Tree Synthesis).
. Routing: (Connecting metal layers).
. Signoff: (Magic/KLayout checks).
```
```
Time: This takes approximately 3-5 minutes on the demo machine.
Success Message: [SUCCESS]: Flow Completed Without Fatal Errors.
```
## 4. Phase 3: PPA Analysis & Reporting

**Goal:** Extract the numbers needed for the competition submission.

### Step 4.1: Locating the Metrics File

The speaker navigates to the results folder _after_ exiting Docker (or using a separate terminal).

```
Path:
```

```
cd designs/DP_1/runs/
ls -lt # (Lists runs by time, pick the latest one)
cd <Run_Tag>/reports/
```
```
Target File: metrics.csv
```
### Step 4.2: Key Metrics Interpretation (Spreadsheet View)

The speaker opens the CSV (visualized in Excel/Sheets in the video) and highlights:

```
Column Name Meaning Target
die_area Physical size of the chip. Smaller is better.
Total Internal Power Power consumed by logic. Lower is better.
```
```
wns (Worst Negative Slack) Timing margin. Must be Positive.
```
```
tns (Total Negative Slack) Sum of all timing violations. Must be Zero.
```
```
Speaker Warning: "If wns is negative (e.g., -2.34), your chip does not work at the requested
speed. You must optimize your logic or lower the clock speed."
```
### Step 4.3: Visualizing the Layout (GDSII)

To see the physical chip:

```
. Navigate: cd results/final/gds/
. Command: klayout tt_wrapper.gds
. Visual: The screen shows the intricate metal layers. The speaker zooms in to show standard cells
(NAND/NOR gates) placed in rows.
```
## 5. Troubleshooting & AI Tips (From Screen Context)

```
Prompt Logging: The speaker has a sidebar open showing his chat history with Gemini. He
reiterates that you must save these logs.
Error Handling:
If Yosys fails: "Copy the exact ERROR line from the terminal."
Paste into AI: "I got this error in Yosys: [Error]. How do I x it?"
Speaker Insight: "The AI usually tells you if you missed a le in the read_verilog list."
```

**Path Issues:** If OpenLANE says "File not found", check the config.json. Ensure the

```
VERILOG_FILES list matches the actual le names in the directory exactly (case-sensitive).
```
