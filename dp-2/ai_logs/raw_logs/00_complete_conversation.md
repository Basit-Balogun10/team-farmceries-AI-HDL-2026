User: Let's move onto DP-2, I guess?

The relevant docs are #file:AI-HDL 2026 - Design Phase 2 Documentation.md 

Let's get into it, what do we have here?

GitHub Copilot: Optimizing tool selection...You’re moving into DP-2 planning, so I’ll quickly extract the exact phase requirements from the DP-2 document and cross-check them against your current DP-1 repo state to give you a concrete, no-fluff starting plan.

I’ll do one focused code-level pass on the secure UART datapath so your DP-2 plan is tied to real bottlenecks in this repo, not generic optimization advice.

I now have the core technical context and next I’m checking whether any DP-2 scaffolding already exists so we can either reuse it or create a clean, submission-ready structure immediately.

You’re in a good spot to start DP-2. Here’s what this phase actually asks for and how it maps to your current repo.

**What DP-2 Is**
- Objective: optimize your already functional DP-1 design for power, performance, and area.
- Official source: AI-HDL 2026 - Design Phase 2 Documentation.md
- Required outputs:
1. Optimized RTL
2. Final STA and PPA reports
3. Optimization report with baseline, before/after comparison, and trade-off justification
4. Final tag named DP2-Submission
- Note: the doc says “Required for DP1 Submission” in the deliverables block, but context clearly indicates DP-2 deliverables: AI-HDL 2026 - Design Phase 2 Documentation.md

**What You Already Have (Strong Baseline)**
- Baseline runs and status are already documented in README.md
- Existing before/after style data (UART vs secure mode) exists in PPA_ANALYSIS.md
- Your flow script already supports tunable AES block-size experiments and PPA controls:
  - AES experiment knob: run_synthesis_and_ppa.sh
  - Floorplan and synthesis knobs: run_synthesis_and_ppa.sh, run_synthesis_and_ppa.sh, run_synthesis_and_ppa.sh

**Where DP-2 Work Should Focus in Your RTL**
- Streaming crypto datapath complexity and buffering behavior:
  - aes_uart_streaming.v
  - aes_uart_streaming.v
  - aes_uart_streaming.v
- Secure top-level integration and status/interrupt behavior:
  - secure_uart_peripheral.v
  - secure_uart_peripheral.v
  - secure_uart_peripheral.v

**Practical DP-2 Plan For Your Team**
1. Freeze one baseline config
- Use your current closed secure configuration as the Week 1 baseline reference.
2. Set measurable goals
- Timing: improve WNS/TNS from current secure baseline.
- Power: reduce dynamic switching in secure path.
- Area: reduce cell count or improve utilization headroom.
3. Implement two optimization classes
- Microarchitecture: shorten critical combinational paths in streaming and control logic.
- Power: add clock-enable style gating in inactive AES/UART subpaths.
4. Run regression and PPA after each change
- Keep a strict before/after table for every optimization step.
5. Package final DP-2 submission
- Optimized RTL, final STA/PPA, justification write-up, DP2-Submission tag.

If you want, next I can directly scaffold a DP-2 workspace package in your repo (optimization plan template, before/after report template, experiment log, and a run matrix) so you can start executing immediately.

User: Nah you do the planning and the execution. 
You can go all in now


GitHub Copilot: Optimizing tool selection...You want full ownership on this, so I am switching to execution mode now: I will set up a concrete DP-2 workstream, implement optimization changes in RTL and flow, run validation where possible, and package a submission-ready DP-2 documentation set. I am starting with a quick repo state and DP-2 baseline scan.

User: @agent Try Again

GitHub Copilot: I’m restarting properly in execution mode now: first I’ll capture the exact repo state and identify where to place DP-2 artifacts, then I’ll implement optimizations plus a reproducible DP-2 reporting flow.

Created 6 todos

I’m running a quick discovery batch to determine what’s already present for DP-2 and what needs to be created, so the next edits are targeted and not redundant.

Next I’m reading the secure UART RTL and top-level integration files end-to-end so I can apply meaningful DP-2 optimizations (not just documentation updates).

I found concrete RTL opportunities (state-machine toggling, bypass handshakes, and clock-enable usage), and I’m now checking the synthesis/test scripts so I can implement and verify optimizations without breaking your existing flow.

Context is now complete; I’m moving into a full DP-2 implementation pass with this execution order:
1. RTL optimization pass in secure UART datapath for lower switching and cleaner handshakes.
2. Flow upgrades to make DP-2 experiments reproducible with tunable physical knobs.
3. Create a DP-2 artifact set (optimization plan, before/after report template, regression log, and comparison tooling).
4. Run regression and synthesis checks, then populate report outputs from real run data where available.
5. Finalize with commit, push, and DP2-Submission tag if validation passes.

I’m starting the RTL and flow edits now.

RTL regression is green (secure UART tests and synthesis passed). Next I’ll attempt DP-2 PPA execution using your local OpenLANE install; if it’s available, I’ll produce actual before/after metrics, otherwise I’ll still finalize the workflow with reproducible commands and report placeholders.
